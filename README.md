This repository contains the codebase for the CSSI front end. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template.

# Quick start

> The generated project have dependencies that require `node` together with `npm`.

**Make sure you have Node version >= 8.0 and (NPM >= 5 or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) )**

```bash
# clone our repository
git clone https://github.com/project-cssi/cssi-fe.git

# change the directory
cd cssi-fe

# switch to development branch
git checkout develop

# install the dependencies with npm
npm install

# start the development server
npm start

```

Once the dev server is fired up, it'll automatically open up a new tab. If not, navigate to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) manually in your browser. (Note: If a port is already taken you'll be given the option to open the app in a different port.)

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

What you need to run this app:

- The generated project have dependencies that require `node` together with `npm`.
- Ensure you're running the latest stable versions Node and NPM.

> Make sure you have `Node` and `NPM` installed by running simple commands on the command line to see what version of each is installed.

- Node - Type `node -v` on the terminal.
- NPM - Type `npm -v` on the terminal.

If you do not have them installed, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and grab the latest stable version of `node` and `npm` will be automatically installed along with it. Or if you have `brew` already installed in your local machine, execute `brew install node` command to get `node`.

## Setting Up

- `git clone https://github.com/project-cssi/cssi-fe.git` to clone the repository
- `cd cssi-fe` to change the directory
- `git checkout develop` to switch to development branch
- `npm install` to install the dependencies with npm

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm start` to start a local server with `webpack`.
The dev server will be opened in a new tab and usually on http://localhost:3000 and the Access URLs will be displayed on the terminal.

# Configuration

Have a look in the [.env.sample](./.env.sample) file for the structure of the `.env` file.

# Styling

The stylesheets are inside the `assets/sass` folder and the `cssi-dashboard.scss` file inside the directory is the main stylesheet for the project.
If you want to add your own stylesheet, we recommend that you place it under the `sass/partials` folder and import it in the `cssi-dashboard.scss` file.

For example if you want to include the styles for a slider:

1. Create a `_slider.scss` partial file in the `sass/partials` directory.
2. In `cssi-dashboard.scss` add `@import 'partials/slider.scss';`

# Testing

The app uses Jest and Enzyme frameworks for testing and you can run the test suite by executing the following command.

```bash
npm run test
```

# Production

Follow the steps bellow to build a production ready version of the application.

## Building the app

Execute the following command to build the application with webpack in production mode.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Releases

Please read the [RELEASES.md](./docs/RELEASES.md) guideline to learn about the process for releasing the project.

## Deployment

### AWS

If you want to deploy the application to a s3 bucket please execute the following command replacing `bucket_name` with the intended s3 bucket name.

The script for this command can be found in the `scripts/deploy-s3.js`. Feel free to change it if needed.

```bash
npm run deploy-s3 bucket_name
```

# Linting

To run the linting on the command line, execute the following command.

```bash
npm run lint
```
